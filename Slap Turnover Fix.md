Summary:
The grace period given to players when they grab the [[Scoring Object]] (from being taken from them immediately) should only apply when the [[Scoring Object]] turns over to a player of the opposite team.

Discussion:
[Concern](https://discord.com/channels/1092928496474521700/1125504784858894506/1125506511490265188) This might make interactions with the [[Scoring Object]] clunky and confusing.
[Suggestion Modification](https://discord.com/channels/1092928496474521700/1125504784858894506/1125509226404519946) Make it so the grace period ends when the [[Scoring Object]] leaves your hand.
