Discussion:
- [Suggestion Addition](https://discord.com/channels/1092928496474521700/1122165920454955010/1122169084533026866) Team only comms would not be spatial and would not falloff over distance.
- [Dev Input](https://discord.com/channels/1092928496474521700/1122165920454955010/1122250417116553246) [[BiffBish]] "1. It's kinda anti diagetic to mute the other team for no aparent reason, Or have yourself be muted for others. Id say mute other team but still have an "open" mic is more likely then team only chat"

- [Concern](https://discord.com/channels/1092928496474521700/1122165920454955010/1123625280699900055) You may be missing out by not hearing other players.
